# Simulate_CPU_Schedule

#Setup

Consider a single person arcade game machine located in a shopping centre. While many customers wish to play, there is only one machine, so it is a shared resource. Customers willing to play arrive at random times and if the machine is occupied, they need to wait. This is a very advanced shopping centre and the use of the machine is facilitated by a robot manager (programmed by you!). In particular, the robot may decide that a customer is playing for too long and ask the customer to release the machine and move back to the waiting queue.

Based on the membership with the gaming company, there are two customer priorities: high for members and regular for non-members. Also, to facilitate scheduling, each customer must declare how many time units they will be playing for in total. Once a customer spends this amount of time at the machine (in one or multiple sessions), they leave.

I have write a program that decides which customer should be playing when.
